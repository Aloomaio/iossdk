 @method

 @abstract
 Initializes and returns a singleton instance of the API.

 @discussion
 If you are only going to send data to a single Alooma input from your app,
 as is the common case, then this is the easiest way to use the API. This
 method will set up a singleton instance of the <code>Alooma</code> class for
 you using the given project token. When you want to make calls to Alooma
 elsewhere in your code, you can use <code>sharedInstance</code>.

 To enable easy intergration of the Alooma API in normal applications as well
 as widgets and watch apps, a modification was contributed to the Alooma
 library, enabling it to accept a pointer to the current application. This
 change replaces the previous method of setting the preprocessor flag
 ALOOMA_APP_EXTENSION which would cause the Alooma API to refrain from calling
 [UIApplication sharedApplication]. (The preprocessor flag required developers
 to perform some inconvenient configurations to include the Alooma API in a
 single project which compiles both an app and a widget).
 <b>This is a breaking change</b>


 <pre>
 [Alooma sharedInstanceWithToken:@"<token>" serverURL:@"inputs.alooma.com"
                     application:[UIApplication sharedApplication]];
 [Alooma sharedInstance] track:@"Something Happened"]];
 </pre>

 If you are going to use this singleton approach,
 <code>sharedInstanceWithToken:</code> <b>must be the first call</b> to the
 <code>Alooma</code> class, since it performs important initializations to
 the API.

 @param apiToken        your project token
 @param url             your server url

/*!
 @property

 @abstract
 Sets the distinct ID of the current user.

 @discussion
 Alooma will choose a default distinct ID based on
 whether you are using the AdSupport.framework or not.

 If you are not using the AdSupport Framework (iAds), then we use the
 <code>[UIDevice currentDevice].identifierForVendor</code> (IFV) string as the
 default distinct ID.  This ID will identify a user across all apps by the same
 vendor, but cannot be used to link the same user across apps from different
 vendors.

 If you are showing iAds in your application, you are allowed use the iOS ID
 for Advertising (IFA) to identify users. If you have this framework in your
 app, Alooma will use the IFA as the default distinct ID. If you have
 AdSupport installed but still don't want to use the IFA, you can define the
 <code>MIXPANEL_NO_IFA</code> preprocessor flag in your build settings, and
 Alooma will use the IFV as the default distinct ID.

 If we are unable to get an IFA or IFV, we will fall back to generating a
 random persistent UUID.

 This method is intended to be used in advance of events that have

 call to record its duration.
